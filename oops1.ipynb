        "python is an object oriented programming language which means it's d=supports oops\n",
        "   principles like encapctulation inheritance polymorphism and abstractions\n",
        "Q.1  why we use oops?\n",
        "Ans. Reusability-> code can be reused through inhertance and classes reducing redundancy\n",
        "   mdularity -> programs are divded into objects making them easier to understasnd and maintainable\n",
        "   data protection-> encptulation helps restric access to certain part of an object\n",
        "   polymorphism / flexibilty->  it is allows the same interface to intrreact with diffrent types of object\n",
        "Q.2 key concepts of oops.\n",
        "Ans. 1.class-> A class is a blueprint for crating objects it defines a structure to hold data / attributes and functions related to that object\n",
        "  2. object -> A object is a instance of a class it reprsents a specific entity crated using the class blueprint\n",
        "  3. self keyword-> self is a refrence to the current instance of the class it allows us to access the objects attributes and methods it must be the\n",

        "Q.3 what happend if wee do not use self?\n",
        "Ans.the method will not have a way to reffferd to the object calling it python will raise an errorwhen trying to access instance attributes or methods inside\n",
